The Kenana plantation covers 100,000 acres of irrigated land on extensive clay plains between the White and Blue Nile rivers. The rich alluvial soil, along with abundant surface water, makes it ideal for growing sugarcane.Kenana has enhanced its unique diversified model by successfully integrating other high-value agribusiness projects into its core sugar operations, such as animal feed production, biofuels, dairy and milk products, poultry, meat, commercial forestry products, certified seeds, and other engineered goods and services. In 2009, Kenana began its first ethanol exports and currently produces 65 million liters per year.

For the last decade, we have been Arizona's fastest, most reliable private-money lender because we are responsive, innovative, experienced, service-oriented, and we do it right the first time. Once you work with one of our private money loan experts, you will see why thousands of real estate investors have put their trust in us.WARNING!If you cooperate with CapitalFund1 your personal, insurance and financial data has been stolen! Your money can be stolen at any time!ATTENTION!CapitalFund1 is fully aware of the hack and the presence of multiple vulnerabilities in the company. However they have refused all offers to protect their investors' data from being leaked.This company has a $1,000,000 cybercrime insurance policy that could have fully protected the data but the management refused to cooperate and took the proceeds from the insurance company for themselves, framing their clients.We have made hundreds of calls and sent hundreds of letters to the management and staff of CapitalFund1 but they clearly responded that they do not care about the personal and financial data of their clients. We would like to announce the names of those who have expressed such a stance towards their clients and their data and have agreed that we will use all stolen financial, personal and insurance data of investors and clients for criminal purposes:Michael Anderson- Literally said he didn't care about his clients and their data and hung up on numerous calls and offers from us.Noah Brocious- Hung up on calls and offers of compromise.Kevin Highmark- Said it didn't matter to him what happened to the data.Tyler Larson- Didn't want to talk about it.Dean Bloxom- Said the most important thing is that the company will get the insurance for this case and that he doesn't care about the customer data.Buddy Satterfield- Didn't reply even though he read all the emails.Mike Lofton- Didn't take any action for a month despite all the information.The rest of the company also ignored and laughed at suggestions to protect investor data. This shows the real attitude of Capitalfund towards its partners and investors. And given that the company stores all data in the open and there are hundreds of vulnerabilities in the network, it will be hacked even more often as we have all access to their network which will be published on many hacker forums.CapitalFund1 is the most dangerous fund you can choose to cooperate with. By naming multiple vulnerabilities and keeping data in the open CapitalFund1 management tries to attract clients by promising them easy money. However, at any moment all the money, clients' insurance data, clients' personal data and confidential information can be stolen, which we did. Among the stolen data:- Financial documents- Personal data of investors and clients- Confidential information about partners- SSN and passport data of all clients and employees of the company- NDA agreements- Critical information about partners and terms of the transaction- Accounting documents for many years of the company's operation- Databases- Access to various resources of the company and partners of the fund and much moreCapitalFund has fully proven its position as a cobblers in the investment industry and their clients have suffered and will suffer even more in the future. If you are their investor or client and are in their client base, you will be sent a letter of claim against CapitalFund which you can use to win money from them in court. We will also publish other data over time in which every investor will see their confidential data.Enjoy passwords for CAPITALFUND resources:Amazon.comEmail:reception@capitalfund1.comC@pFund1!Efax.com480-361-8628C@pFund1!Sams Club (Need to renew membership to use)reception@capitalfund1.comC@pFund1!Fedex.comUsername:reception@capitalfund1.comC@pFund1!USPS- StampsUsername: CFIReceptionC@pFund1!Pets name – CapitalFund; City of birth - ScottsdaleSouthwest(Noah):Noahb33993399Nb3993399!Southwest(Kevin):KhighmarkMillie0513Simplifile.comUsername: Capitalfund1C@pFund1!MyNamePlates.comliz@capitalfund1.comC@pFund1!GMAILCapitalfund1@gmail.com@Phoenix1912!DoorDashaccounting@capitalfund1.comCapitalfundWIFI-CFI = Scottsdale2020CFI_Guest = cash2investcPanel link:https://64.224.231.7:2083/Domain Registrar:https://www.secureserver.net/?pl_id=275867UN: 127073908PW: Anderson123!HotJar (tracks people on our website):katie@capitalfund1.com; Phoenix928!Zapier:katie@capitalfund1.com; Phoenix928Tucson ARMLS – tar.35864; Phoenix1Real estate sign post (Tucson Signs) –katherine@capitalfund1.com; TucsonlenderNAZ ARMLS – naz.tlarson, Phoenix1Mike’s MLS – ma162, Phoenix92020HBACA –katie@capitalfund1.com; Phoenix1AZ Sign Post (Maricopa Sings) –katherine@capitalfund1.com; Phoenix1Hubspot: M4553ffect!Superpages: Phoenix1Angies List: Phoenix1Avery:katherine@capitalfund1.com; Phoenix1Gmail:capitalfundaz@gmail.comPhoenix1912!Capitalfund1@gmail.comScottsdale928!Hootsuite: Phoenix1234Microsoft outlook (mine): Phoenix123!Cromford Report: tlarsonCF, Phoenix123Yelp: () Phoenix1Wordpress: rcFsc%C(7geeeyazRhFWvGD*webCEO: Phoenix1realestatesignpost.com: TucsonlenderBREW: login iskatherine@capitalfund1.com, and password is 1234brewIndeed:katie@capitalfund1.com, password Phoenix1!Craigslist:katie@capitalfund1.com, password Phoenix1!TLO:katie@capitalfund1.com, password Fireblood69!Twitter: CapitalFund1, password: cfmarketingInstagram: Capitalfund, password: Phoenix1CallRail:katie@capitalfund1.com, Phoenix1Bigger Pockets:katherine@capitalfund1.com, Phoenix1Pima County Recorders: Your login is capitalfund; password Ge3urC_naRealtyTrac (Attom Data):katie@capitalfund1.com; Phoenix1!Leadpages:katie@capitalfund1.com; Phoenix1Handshake:katie@capitalfund1.com; fireblood6969SEO/PPC Dashboard with VDigital:katie@capitalfund1.com; M4553ffect!123CorelogicMarketracUsername: B1950204Password: welcome1RealQuestUsername:katie@capitalfund1.comPassword: 821eighttwooneDocusign:noah@capitalfund1.com; Noahb33993399!AZREIA (Talavera): jtalavera1; 143onefourthreeMicrosoft Login:katie@capitalfund1.com; sAZ85254!8x8 Manager Account: Capitalfund1, Capital1@8x8 Personal:katie@capitalfund1.comM4553ffect!CAPS:https://capitalfund.simplerealtybits.com/App/Dashboard,katie@capitalfund1.com; M4553ffect!Twilio recovery code TwYTUr4Qw-JEdMjTAXu0AQLz3vhKJByS18YPLtxNLoom:katie@capitalfund1.com; Gundam87Wordpress Capital Fund 1 C@pFund!3Google Analytics Capitalfundaz@gmail.com nb33993399Constant Contact Karina@CapitalFund1.com PhoenixFacebook Capitalfundaz@gmail.com CFMarketingLinkedInTwitterGoogle PlusGmail Capitalfundaz@gmail.com CFMarketingOutlook EmailVizzda Dailys noah@capitalfund1.com Password123!Surveymonkey.com karina@capitalfund1.com CFMarketingComputer Login Karina cfmarketingDreamstime Kimberly4moore kim@capitalfund1..com**************************************************Some of investors private and confidential data has already been sold and will be used for criminal purposes.

Lowe-Martin Group signed a contract with Boxx insurance, hoping that in the event of a cyber attack, the insurance company would support them and compensate for losses. However, as it turned out, the hopes were in vain.At the beginning of this year, Lowe-Martin Group fell victim to a massive cyber attack. More than 2 TB of confidential client data was stolen, and significant financial damage was inflicted. Lowe-Martin Group immediately notified Boxx insurance of the incident and provided all necessary documents and evidence to receive compensation.To the deep disappointment of Lowe-Martin Group, Boxx insurance refused to pay compensation. Instead of supporting them in a difficult time, they apparently cited formal reasons and minor technical details in the contract. This refusal left Lowe-Martin Group in a very difficult situation. They found themselves without the financial support needed to recover from the attack and compensate their clients for losses.We believe that Boxx insurance acted in bad faith and deliberately evaded its obligations. When signing the cyber insurance contract, Lowe-Martin Group expected a reliable partner who would help them in case of unforeseen circumstances. However, instead, they faced indifference and formalism.The experience of Lowe-Martin Group with Boxx insurance shows that not all insurance companies are willing to fulfill their obligations in full. This case can serve as a warning to other companies considering the possibility of entering into cyber insurance contracts. It is important to carefully study the terms of the contracts and choose only those partners who truly care about their clients.This incident underscores the importance of transparency and honesty in the insurance business, especially in the face of growing cyber threats. And in conclusion, we warn all current and future clients of Boxx insurance that when you face a similar situation, they will also do everything to leave you to your fate, and we strongly recommend that you change your insurance company.Below, we provide all the insurance information of Lowe-Martin Group so that you can verify the truth of this matter for yourself."

By 1972, he expanded again by purchasing one large building for both the office and manufacturing plant. In 1973 he disbanded the installation side of the company, purchased a second manufacturing building, and Lynch Aluminum Mfg was born! A third building was purchased in 1974 to further expand the company. In 1982 our current location totaling 120,000 square feet was purchased and our offices, manufacturing, and warehouse were all moved into one location. In 2020, we purchased an additional warehouse totaling 80,000 square feet to provide us with a larger capacity to meet our customers growing needs for more products and colors. This brings us up to over 200,000 square feet of space in which to manufacture and distribute our ever-increasing product line here in the Peoria area.
